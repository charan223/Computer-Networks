ASSIGNMENT2::REPORT (ANALYZE PACKET TRACES AT VARIOUS HOSTS/SWITCHES USING WIRESHARK)
                               ------- G.Sai Bharath Chandra (14CS10020)

PART1:
     
      To Capture Packets and extract data we have used a script and plotted the required graphs from the data obtained so
      All instructions to follow to get the data are shown in the script itself in the zip file with filename "script1.py" 
 
      
      In TCP only the data packets have to be counted excluding the acknowledgement packets from server to client ,
      in this case from h2 to h1.

     1. TCP and ARP packet traces were found captured at h1 and h2 for TCP transmission for the given topology
 
	Number  packets_sent   packets_received    bytes_sent   bytes_received    TCPgoodput        Packet_loss
	0       419            333                 1039688      797872            0.767414839837    86
 
     2. The data report and plots for UDPThroughput , PacketLoss , UDPNormalizedThroughput vs Bandwidth are shown in
        their corresponding folders with filenames throughput.txt , Packlostswitches.txt , Normthtoughput.txt 

      
PART2:
 
       The data report and plots for UDPThroughput , PacketLoss , UDPNormalizedThroughput vs Bandwidth are shown in
       their corresponding folders (folders from 1 to 9 corresponding to each bandwidth for link b/w switches) with filenames
       plots are saved in graphs folder.       
       All data in the below files corresponding to bandwidth in the first column are in Kbps
       >>> throughput.txt 
       >>> Packlostswitches.txt 
       >>> Normthtoughput.txt all data in kbps

     In case of UDP most packet traces are found from client to server , in this case from h1 to h2 , and also there are few 
     UDP data packets found from server to client i.e from h2 to h1 , But comparatiely this number is very very small compared
     with total packet traces , hence in our script we have included all the packets and  also since we calculated fractional packet
     loss the error margin doesn't really stand out.
